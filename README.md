# Riemann Hypothesis in the Lean Theorem Prover

In this repository, we construct the statement of the Riemann Hypothesis using elementary methods of analysis.

## Documentation

Most of the documentation will be kept up to date inline in the Lean files, but this repository also includes a [paper](docs/paper) and a [website](docs/website) hosted at [reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~bg441](https://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~bg441).
